# Director of Customer Acquisition [1]

Apply @ [http://seatgeek.com/jobs/inbound_marketing/](http://seatgeek.com/jobs/inbound_marketing/), and read more here:

## Why is this important to us?

We don’t do paid marketing at SeatGeek; all users find us via unpaid channels [2]. We humbly believe we have the best ticket search site on the web and, accordingly, much of our growth comes from word-of-mouth referrals. But there are ways we accelerate that growth to bring SeatGeek in front of prospective users more quickly. That’s where you come in...

##What will I do?

You will be in charge of all customer acquisition for SeatGeek. Since we currently only do inbound marketing, that will be your focus. You’ll be starting with a set of proven channels. The biggest is SEO--you’ll define SEO strategy, oversee all content creation, maintain an optimal site architecture, and make sure SEO goals help, not hinder, our focus on user experience. In addition to SEO, you’ll be in charge of email marketing, customer retention, landing page optimization, and site analytics. You’ll be deeply involved with the SeatGeek product, working closely with our dev team as we build new stuff.

##Is this for me?

SeatGeek is in an unusual place right now. After three years of steady growth, s*** is getting real. We’ve grown 50% over the past two months. We hit profitability in August, and blew way past it in September. We're on the verge of launching several major product updates. I mention all of this because all of that makes this an atypical opportunity. You’ll be thrown into something that’s growing quickly and people will expect you to make it grow even faster. But you'll have an incredible team, great product, and active user base at your disposal. Out of the gate, you’ll be responsible for managing one full-time employee and a team of contractors. We hope that soon grows into a larger team under your stewardship. If the above sounds exciting, we’d love to talk.

## Responsibilities

- Refine SEO strategy, both at a macro and micro level
- Manage site content
- Stay on top of SEO news and consider how it applies to SeatGeek
- Monitor and report on site analytics; use to make recommendations
- Manage 1+ full-time employees and a team of contractors
- Run the SeatGeek intern program
- Manage email marketing and customer retention. Brainstorm email topics, write copy, create emails (if you know HTML/CSS...if not, - you’ll learn), monitor results.
- Conceive and implement custom landing pages and multivariate tests
- Run marketing contests

## Essential skills/background

- Bachelors degree and 2+ years of professional experience
- Fluent with Excel (e.g. this challenge doesn’t phase you)
- Strong analytical skills; deeply comfortable with data
- Strong technical understanding of how the web works, including html, http, search engines, etc.
- Comfortable writing, both longform and copywriting
- Extensive experience with web analytics. Have used Google Analytics for multiple sites.
- Detail-oriented; perfectionist

## Nice-to-have skills/background

- HTML/CSS and MySQL (these fall somewhere between “nice to have” and “essential”...if you don’t already know them, you’ll have to learn quickly)
- Javascript, PHP and/or other web scripting languages
- Professional SEO experience. Experience using SEO tools, including Google Webmaster Tools.
- Photoshop
- Email marketing experience

[1]: If it wasn't exceedingly trite, I might call this something like "Head Growth Hacker."

[2]: There are a few minor exceptions to this, e.g. we run AdWords against branded terms, but the amount spent is trivial. It's worth noting that this may change soon--we're considering delving into paid marketing. If we do that, you could get involved, and even lead the effort, if you're interested. But the state of that is a bit up in the air, so for the purpose of this post it shouldn't be considered a core part of the job.
